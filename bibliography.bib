@article{Ritter2017,
   abstract = {The discipline of enterprise application integration (EAI) enables the decoupled communication between (business) applications, and thus became a cornerstone of today's IT architectures. In 2004, the book by Hohpe and Woolf on Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) provided a fundamental collection of messaging patterns, denoting the building blocks of many EAI system implementations. Since then, multiple new trends and a broad range of new application scenarios have emerged, e. g., cloud and mobile computing, multimedia streams. These developments ultimately lead to conceptual changes and challenges such as larger data volumes (i. e., message sizes), a growing number of messages (i. e., velocity) and communication partners, and even more diverse message formats (i. e., variety). However, the research since 2004 focused on isolated EAI solutions, and thus a broader and integrated analysis of solutions and new patterns is missing. In this survey, we summarize new trends and application scenarios which serve as a frame to structure our survey of academic research on EIP, existing systems for EAI and also to classify integration patterns from these sources. We evaluate recently developed integration solutions and patterns in the context of real-world integration scenarios. Finally, we derive and summarize remaining challenges and open research questions.},

@article{Freire2019,
   abstract = {Companies are taking advantage of cloud computing to upgrade their business processes. Cloud computing requires interaction with many kinds of applications, so it is necessary to improve the performance of software tools that allow keeping information on all these applications consistent and synchronised. Integration platforms are specialised software tools that provide support to design, implement, run, and monitor integration solutions, which aim to orchestrate a set of applications so as to promote compatibility among their data or to develop new functionality on top of the current ones. The run-time system is the part of the integration platform responsible for running the integration solutions, which makes its performance the uttermost important issue. The contribution of this article is two-fold: a framework and an evaluation of integration platforms. The former is a framework composed of ten properties grouped into two dimensions to evaluate the run-time systems focusing on performance. Using this framework as reference, the second contribution is an evaluation of nine open-source integration platforms, which represent the state-of-the-art, provide support to the integration patterns, and follow the pipes-and-filters architectural style. In addition, as a result of this work, we suggest open research directions that can be explored to improve the performance of the run-time systems and at the same time may be useful to adapt them to the context of cloud computing.},

   abstract = {The growing number of (cloud) applications and devices massively increases the communication rate and volume pushing integration systems to their (throughput) limits. While the usage of modern hardware like Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) led to low latency when employed for query and event processing, application integration adds yet unexplored processing opportunities. In this industry paper, we explore how to program integration semantics (e. g., message routing and transformation) in form of Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) on top of an FPGA, thus complementing the existing research on FPGA data processing. We focus on message routing, re-define the EIP for stream processing and propose modular hardware implementations as templates that are synthesized to circuits. For our real-world "connected car" scenario (i. e., composed patterns), we discuss common and new optimizations especially relevant for hardware integration processes. Our experimental evaluation shows competitive throughput compared to modern general-purpose CPUs and discusses the results.},
